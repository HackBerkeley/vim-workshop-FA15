The following are *really, really* helpful. I'm sure there are other
similarly-great resources, (they are by no means the only way to learn Vim)
but these are all great. I like to keep things short, so I only put things
that I think are really important here. Go through all of these.

- **Do the `vimtutor`!** (interactive Vim tutorial in the form of a
  self-explaining text file that you edit)
    - This is literally a program called `vimtutor` that ships with Vim, so
      you should be able to just type `vimtutor` into your terminal.
- **[Learn to use `:help`!][help]**
    - Vim has a very helpful and comprehensive built-in help system.
    - I just want to emphasize this with a second bullet point: because lots
      of other programs and editors have really bad built-in help, you might
      not expect Vim's help to be any good. But it is. So use it.
    - I generally use it as a reference, e.g. to look up the things I don't
      want to memorize, like [all the flags for the `:s` command][:s-flags].
      But you can also just read through whole sections of it and learn about
      stuff!
- **Required reading:**
    - *[Seven habits of effective text editing][seven-habits]* (What it sounds
      like. This is written by Bram Moolenaar, the author of Vim!)
    - "[Your problem with Vim is that you don't grok vi][grok-vi]"

Aside from those, just delve into the internet and learn things as you go, or
as you feel like it. Here are a few communities I like. (But, obviously,
Google is always your friend.)
