<p>The following are <em>really, really</em> helpful. I'm sure there are other similarly-great resources, (they are by no means the only way to learn Vim) but these are all great. I like to keep things short, so I only put things that I think are really important here. Go through all of these.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Do the <code>vimtutor</code>!</strong> (interactive Vim tutorial in the form of a self-explaining text file that you edit)
<ul>
<li>This is literally a program called <code>vimtutor</code> that ships with Vim, so you should be able to just type <code>vimtutor</code> into your terminal.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong><a href="http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Learn_to_use_help">Learn to use <code>:help</code>!</a></strong>
<ul>
<li>Vim has a very helpful and comprehensive built-in help system.</li>
<li>I just want to emphasize this with a second bullet point: because lots of other programs and editors have really bad built-in help, you might not expect Vim's help to be any good. But it is. So use it.</li>
<li>I generally use it as a reference, e.g. to look up the things I don't want to memorize, like <a href="http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/change.html#:s_flags">all the flags for the <code>:s</code> command</a>. But you can also just read through whole sections of it and learn about stuff!</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Required reading:</strong>
<ul>
<li><em><a href="http://www.moolenaar.net/habits.html">Seven habits of effective text editing</a></em> (What it sounds like. This is written by Bram Moolenaar, the author of Vim!)</li>
<li>&quot;<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/1220118/1945088">Your problem with Vim is that you don't grok vi</a>&quot;</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Aside from those, just delve into the internet and learn things as you go, or as you feel like it. Here are a few communities I like. (But, obviously, Google is always your friend.)</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/vim">/r/vim on Reddit</a></li>
<li>The relevant tags on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/vim">StackOverflow</a> and <a href="http://superuser.com/questions/tagged/vim">SuperUser</a></li>
