<ul>
<li><strong>Just type this into your terminal:</strong> <code>sudo apt-get install vim</code> (You will be prompted for your password.)</li>
<li><strong>Once it's done,</strong> you can run Vim by just typing <code>vim</code> into your terminal.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you haven't seen this sort of command before,</p>
<ul>
<li><code>apt-get</code> is your package manager, and it allows you to easily install all sorts of useful programs.</li>
<li><code>sudo</code> (which is what asks for your password) is required when doing potentially-dangerous things like installing new programs or modifying system files.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="mac">Mac</h1>
<ul>
<li>Good news! <strong>Mac ships with Vim included.</strong> It's a slightly out-of-date version, but it won't matter for this workshop.</li>
<li>You can just type <code>vim</code> into your terminal.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h1 id="windows">Windows</h1>
<ul>
<li>Go to the download page on the official Vim website, which you can find <a href="http://www.vim.org/download.php#pc">here.</a></li>
<li>It's pretty easy to install.
<ul>
<li><strong>Download the installer:</strong> Click <code>gvim74.exe</code> link in the &quot;PC: MS-DOS and MS-Windows&quot; section.</li>
<li><strong>The defaults are pretty good, but:</strong> Make sure &quot;Create .bat files for command line use&quot; is checked. This will allow you to type <code>vim</code> or <code>gvim</code> into Command Prompt to open up Vim.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h1 id="other">Other</h1>
<p>I don't know the specifics for any other OSes, but:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The download page:</strong> <a href="http://www.vim.org/download.php">Click me!</a></li>
<li><strong>Obviously, you might also try Googling</strong> for installation istructions for your particular OS.</li>
<li><strong>If you're on a Linux or Unix</strong> system, you might have Vim installed already. Try typing <code>vim</code> into your terminal.</li>
<li><strong>If that doesn't work,</strong> you might still have some implementation of vi (Vim's predecessor) installed. Try typing <code>vi</code> into your terminal. If this works, you'll be able to do most of the stuff in this workshop, but a few things probably won't work.</li>
</ul>
